## Abstract

(10 points) 

This analysis seeks to expand upon the previous genre classification covered in class in broadening the scope to a greater number of genres and tracks, utilizing the diverse and vast resources available from the Spotify API. Using songs sampled from different genre playlists generated by Spotify, we seek to answer the question: which genres will be classified with the highest degree of accuracy? We hypothesize that genres considered intuitively unique by humans, such as Hip Hop and Classical, will be classified correctly most often. Spotify’s API will provide us with the features we will use for classification, such as energy, loudness, acousticness, and tempo. In addition to this, we will personally extract features from the sample audio including Time Series, Mel Frequencies, and MFCCs. In order to carry out our analysis to completion we will make use of librosa, pandas, and scikit-learn. We will use these two factors (the audio features and the sample audio) to develop a classifier and determine its accuracy by comparing the classified genre to the genre playlist the song was contained in.

While much of our analysis will lie in the exploratory data analysis and classification, we will also make use of visualization: both in visualizing the feature differences between genres during the exploratory stage, as well as visualizing the differences in classification accuracy in order to communicate our results. The significance of this analysis lies in its ability to highlight the particularly unique genres amid the music we listen to and in its use of Spotify— a popular music streaming service that is used by millions of listeners worldwide.


## Data

(10 points) 

Our cultural data source was a collection of playlists from the online music streaming service Spotify. The playlists in question were hand-crafted by Spotify in order to provide music to listeners who are seeking a specific genre.
From Spotify's API, we acquired information about the tracks contained on 18 different playlists.

The music contained within these playlists spans centuries, ranging from Cello Suites by Johann Sebastian Bach, to Hip Hop music composed a few days ago. And, of course, the artists who created these songs are equally as varied. The playlists themselves are quite frequently updated by Spotify, and thus very recent cultural artifacts.  
As for the matter of whether or not it is a digital native, this too depends on which song is in question. Many of the classical and jazz pieces may be recordings of a recent performance of the song, whereas many of the modern tracks could possibly be digital releases from the beginning. 
It is from the heterogeny of this dataset that we seek to find underlying patterns and different characteristics of each of these genres. In finding these patters, we will eventually be able to classify one from the other, and from this find how near-- or far-- some of these genres are from one another.

In terms of the data values we are analyzing, each feature comes from one of two origins. 
One of these origins is Spotify's API itself. Spotify's API provides us with many of [its own analyses](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/) of the song in question. These range from tempo or time signature, to how instrumental and how "danceable" the music is.
As for the other origin, we ourselves analyzed the 30 second samples provided to us by Spotify's API. From this 30 second sample, we extracted the time series, Mel frequencies, and MFCCs of each sample audio.

Data Acquisition: [link](code/Data%20Scraping.ipynb)  
Here, we made use of Spotify's API in order to retrieve information about the tracks contained inside 18 different playlists. These were then put into pandas dataframes and saved as CSV files.

Feature Extraction / Data Processing: [link](code/Data%20Processing.ipynb)  
Here, we made use of librosa in order to extract features from Spotify's 30 second sample audio, adding these features to the pandas dataframes from the last section, and saving them as separate CSV files.

Exploratory Data Analysis: [link](code/EDA.ipynb)  
Here, we combined the each of the genres' data into a [combined dataframe](./data/combined.csv) used Pandas and Matplotlib to explore the data we had collected. We explored how the main Spotify features differed for each genre to get a better sense of the data we were working with.

Classification / Results Generation: [link](code/Classification.ipynb)  
Here, we trained a Naives Bayes classifier on the combined dataframe, eventually achieving an accuracy of 0.773333. Following this, we used Matplotlib to create charts of our results detailing the predictions of the classifier.

## Results

(30 points) 

This section will contain links to documentation of your results. This can include figures, sound files, videos, bitmaps, as appropriate to your domain of analysis. Each result should include a brief textual description, and all should be listed below: 

- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`)
- written text as `.pdf`


#### Exploratory Data Analysis

Focusing on the features provided for each track by Spotify, we took a look at how the features differed by genre by using Matplotlib to create some simple visualizations.

<a href="./results/meanfeatures.png"><img src="./results/meanfeatures.png" alt="Mean Features by Genre Bar Plot" width="800"/></a>
<p>The bar plot shows the mean of certain <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/">Spotify features</a> for each genre. We can see that some genres have larger values of a feature on average, which will be good distinctions when training the genre classifier. For example, we can see that hiphop music is higher in 'speechiness' and 'danceability', jazz and classical music are higher in 'acousticness' and 'instrumentalness', and rock and punk music are higher in 'energy' and 'liveness'.</p>

Following this, we trained a Naive Bayes classifier on this data in an effort to predict the genre. The classifier had an overall accuracy of 0.773333.

The results of the classifier are as follows.

        <td>Here, we found that rock songs were actually classified relatively well by the classifier, only occasionally being mistaken for hip hop. This could be seen as quite counterintuitive, as rock music can be thought of as similar to many other genres, such as punk. Nevertheless, our classifier did quite a good job at identifier rock music.</td>

        <td>Our classifier was, by far, most successful at recognizing classical music. One could then argue that Classical music is the most distinct among the genres we analyzed, in having features that are significantly characteristic of Classical-- and only Classical.</td>

        <td><a href="./results/jazz_preds.png"><img src="./results/jazz_preds.png" alt="Jazz Classification Pie Chart" width="1200"/></a></td>
        <td>Jazz suffered from the second-to-highest misclassification rate, and all of these misclassifications were with hip hop. This may also come at a surprise, given it can be seen as a particularly unique genre.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="./results/hiphop_preds.png"><img src="./results/hiphop_preds.png" alt="Hiphop Classification Pie Chart" width="1200"/></a></td>
        <td>Hip hop had an ordinary rate of misclassification by our classifier, and with three other genres. This seems quite natural, as hip hop frequently samples from several other genres, and is a particularly heterogenous genre in music.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="./results/punk_preds.png"><img src="./results/punk_preds.png" alt="Punk Classification Pie Chart" width="1200"/></a></td>
        <td>Our classifier was by far the worst at recognizing punk music. It was misclassified nearly half the time as either rock or hip hop. One takeaway from this may be that punk music is extremely similar to rock and hip hop music from the features we analyzed, and isn't a particularly distinct genre in and of itself.</td>

## Discussion

(30 points, three to five paragraphs)

The first paragraph should be a short summary describing your results.

The subsequent paragraphs could address questions including:
- Why is this culturally relevant?
- How does your computational approach differ from the traditional art historical, musicological, manuel/subjective approach to analyzing your cultural subject? 
- How do you think the original artists/musicians would respond to this type of analysis? Would it change/inform their practice in some way?
- How do your results relate to broader social, cultural, economic political, etc., issues? 
- In what future directions could you expand this work?

## Technical Notes and Dependencies

This work makes use of the packages Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Librosa, Spotipy, and Matplotlib, which must be available.

Moreover, since we made use of the Spotify API, our API key was accessed via environmental variables in order to avoid pushing the key to github. This should be taken into account when attempting to replicate our work.

Lastly, at one point we created a .pikl file in order to transfer our data. This aforementioned .pikl  file had an incomprehensible amount of data saved into arrays, and as a result the file was over two gigabytes large. This may prove inconvenient when trying to replicate our work, as we were not allowed to push this file to github.
