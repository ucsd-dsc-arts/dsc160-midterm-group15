## Abstract

(10 points) 

This analysis seeks to expand upon the previous genre classification covered in class in broadening the scope to a greater number of genres and tracks, utilizing the diverse and vast resources available from the Spotify API. Using songs sampled from different genre playlists generated by Spotify’s API, we seek to answer the question: which genres will be classified with the highest degree of accuracy? We hypothesize that genres considered intuitively unique by humans, such as Rap and Classical, will be classified correctly most often. Spotify’s API will provide us with the features we will use in this analysis, such as energy, loudness, acousticness, and tempo. In order to carry out our analysis to completion we will also make use of pandas and scikit-learn. 

While much of our analysis will lie in the exploratory data analysis and classification, we will also make use of visualization: both in visualizing the feature differences between genres during the exploratory stage, as well as visualizing the differences in classification accuracy in order to communicate our results. The significance of this analysis lies in its ability to highlight the particularly unique genres amid the music we listen to and in its use of Spotify— a popular music streaming service that is used by millions of listeners worldwide.


## Data

(10 points) 

This section will describe your data and its origins. Each item should contain a name of the data source, a link to the source, and any necessary background information such as:
- What is your cultural data source? 
- When was it made? 
- Who created the works? 
- Is it digital native, or is it some kind of scan, recording, photo, etc., of an analog form? 

## Code

(20 points)

This section will link to the various code for your project (stored within this repository). Your code should be executable on datahub, should we choose to replicate your result. This includes code for: 

- data acquisition/scraping
- cleaning
- analysis
- generating results. 

Link each of your notebooks or .py files within this section, and provide a brief explanation of what the code does. Reading this section we should have a sense of how to run your code.

## Results

(30 points) 

This section will contain links to documentation of your results. This can include figures, sound files, videos, bitmaps, as appropriate to your domain of analysis. Each result should include a brief textual description, and all should be listed below: 

- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`)
- written text as `.pdf`

## Discussion

(30 points, three to five paragraphs)

The first paragraph should be a short summary describing your results.

The subsequent paragraphs could address questions including:
- Why is this culturally relevant?
- How does your computational approach differ from the traditional art historical, musicological, manuel/subjective approach to analyzing your cultural subject? 
- How do you think the original artists/musicians would respond to this type of analysis? Would it change/inform their practice in some way?
- How do your results relate to broader social, cultural, economic political, etc., issues? 
- In what future directions could you expand this work?

## Team Roles

Provide an account of individual members and their efforts/contributions to the specific tasks you accomplished.

## Technical Notes and Dependencies

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Additional libraries you are using for this project
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does this code need to run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
